                        I love how you light up when you are passionate about something.
                        Be it pokeclicker, new computer parts, monitors or
                        some game you are currently achievement hunting for, you always go all out
                        and I really enjoy hearing you talking about it. It puts a smile on my face.

                        I love the way you cuddle me and make me feel cozy and safe. You're gentle and sweet and
                        when I'm with you I feel like all the pain and stress of everyday life
                        just dissappears and all that matters is you and me.

                        I love how you've always supported me. You've been the light of my life, my hero.
                        And it's not because you're perfect. It's because you were by my side despite
                        all the issues you were dealing with at the time and
                        you helped me through the toughest time of my life.

                One of the first times I kissed you on VRC.
                Even if it was just in VR it still felt amazing and I felt very close
                to you that's why I can still remember it like it was yesterday.

                Watching Citrus with you was so much fun. I enjoy watching
                things with you and time just flies by. It's one of my favorite things to do.

                The first time I slept with you in VR. Whether it's in VR, in a discord call or in person,
                sleeping with you is the one thing I can always look forward to regardless of how bad the day was
                and I'm forever grateful for that.
